To Professor Mehta: I realized I uploaded the wrong version of the report to CCLE. The version with the cover page and photo of the lamp is uploaded here. Please refer to it for context if necessary. Thank you!

## Description

This project is for a Robotics Capstone at UCLA. Kinematic linkages were implemented using modified Denavit-Hartenberg parameter, which allow for a streamlined process in doing linear transformations between various perspectives. In this case, each link of a robot might operate in its own space, but must be converted to universe frame to be controlled. The project attempts to implement forward and inverse kinematics to derive the end effector position from D-H parameters, and vice versa.

Analysis was completed on a desk lamp.
